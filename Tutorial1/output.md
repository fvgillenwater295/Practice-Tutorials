The **Hello World** project is a time-honored tradition in computer
programming. It is a simple exercise that gets you started when learning
something new. Let’s get started with Tangram Pro™!

**You’ll learn how to:**

-   Create an account

-   Join and create a Team

-   Visualize a simple system by creating Components and defining Interfaces

**What is Tangram Pro™?**
-------------------------

Tangram Pro™ is a code hosting platform for version control and
collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from
anywhere.

This tutorial teaches you Tangram Pro™ essentials like *Teams*,
*Components*, *Interfaces*, and *Connections*. You’ll create your own
Hello World simple system and learn about Tangram Pro™’s workspace, an
intuitive way to collaborate and visualize a system.

#### **No code repository is necessary**

To complete this tutorial, you need a Tangram Pro™ account and Internet
access. You don’t need to know how to code, use the command line, or
connect a repository.

**Tip:** Open this guide in a separate browser window (or tab) so you
can see it while you complete the steps in the tutorial.

Systems and Workflows

Show the AirCraft Mission System

Lift off the lid of the blue box

Relate the more complicated system to the one the User just built

Toggle to Workflows

Show Existing Workflows and results

Tie it all together

If it is connected to code, Workflows triggers can be set

Now you have built a reusable Component; if it changes the Workflow is
kicked off
